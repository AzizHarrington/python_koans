# Greed is a dice game where you roll up to five dice to accumulate
# points.  The following "score" function will be used calculate the
# score of a single roll of the dice.
#
# A greed roll is scored as follows:
#
# * A set of three ones is 1000 points
#
# * A set of three numbers (other than ones) is worth 100 times the
#   number. (e.g. three fives is 500 points).
#
# * A one (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 100 points.
#
# * A five (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 50 points.
#
# * Everything else is worth 0 points.
#
#
# Examples:
#
# score([1, 1, 1, 5, 1]) => 1150 points
# score([2, 3, 4, 6, 2]) => 0 points
# score([3, 4, 5, 3, 3]) => 350 points
# score([1, 5, 1, 2, 4]) => 250 points
#
# More scoring examples are given in the tests below:
#
# Your goal is to write the score method.
